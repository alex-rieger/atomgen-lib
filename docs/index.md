# atomgen

**!!api is not stable!!**

- maintain [atoms](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) or fragments in *`.tsx`-definitions*
- use your *`.tsx`-definitions* to generate code for multiple frameworks
- save time when switching to new frameworks by implementing a new *transpile target* instead of porting all components
- built with [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) and TypeScript
