# atomgen

**!!api is not stable!!**

- maintain [atoms](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) or fragments in _`.tsx`-definitions_
- use your _`.tsx`-definitions_ to generate code for multiple frameworks
- save time when switching to new frameworks by implementing a new _transpile target_ instead of porting all components
- built with [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) and TypeScript
